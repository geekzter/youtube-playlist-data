# YouTube Playlist (meta)data
 
This repo contains a script to fetch YouTube playlist information. It fetches metadata (title, description, etc) and is NOT a video downloader.

## Pre-requisites
This uses the YouTube Data [API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/), you'll need an API key to access it. This can be obtained [here](https://console.developers.google.com/). You can add the API key to the [settings.json](config.json.sample) file, so you don't have to pass it to the script:
```
{
    "ApiKey" : "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
}
```
You will also need [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell) 5 or higher to run the script.


## Running the script
Get the id of the playlist from the playlist's page:
![alt text](url.png "Playlist URL")

Run the script by specifying the playlist id e.g.:
```
./get_playlist_data.ps1 -PlayListID PLbpi6ZahtOH54xRLxXzDneuhq12k36PFj
```

result:
```

       4 Classroom Setup During a Pandemic | Back to School 2020                                    2020-09-23T19:06:36Z https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqebqkup2_c My classroom setup this year is WAY different than ever before since we are currently in the middle of a pandemic. I know districts all over the world have been coming up with different plans for going back to school this year. My district's full plan hasn't been released yet, but as of now they are planning on us going back full time with social distancing and masks. Obviously that can change at any time since things are rapidly changing every day, but in this video I take you along with me as I setup my room to meet the current recommendations....

       7 in person and virtual teaching during a pandemic                                           2020-09-23T19:07:49Z https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NQvMPB8Umw Hi everyone! Thank you so much for being here. In this video, I sit down with you and talk about what teaching has been like for me this year. It is tough to be a teacher in general, but this year has tested us all on a whole new level. Every situation and teacher is different, but I am currently teaching in-person and virtually at the same time, and in this video I explain how I do that. This is what works best for me and my students right now, so please know that this is not the right answer or what you NEED to do--you should always do what is best for you and your class. Sending you all so much love and strength! x Britt...
